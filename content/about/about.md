**Prospective Graduate Students**: I'm currently recruiting new Masters or Doctoral
students.
See [this post](/post/recruiting-grad-2024) if you're interested in working on programming languages theory with me.

I'm Joseph (Joey) Eremondi, an Assistant Professor in
[Computer Science](https://www.uregina.ca/science/cs/) at the
[University of Regina](https://www.uregina.ca/).

My research is centred around type systems for making code more
reliable, and in the theory and practice of making such systems easier
to use. In particular, I'm interested in developing semantics to
increase the flexibility of dependent pattern matching,
mixing dependent types with
gradual types, and improving error messages for dependently-typed
languages. I've also researched the properties of reversal-bounded
counter automata, set constraints, and the shuffle operator on words

Previously, I was Royal Society Newton International Fellow doing
post-doctoral research with with
[Ohad Kammar](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/staff/Ohad_Kammar.html)
in the [Laboratory for Foundations of
Computer Science](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs) at the University of Edinburgh. I completed my PhD
with [Ron Garcia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rxg/) at the
[UBC Software Practices Laboratory](https://spl.cs.ubc.ca/).
